## LaTeX class for *Proceedings of AFLA* (Austronesian Formal Lingusitics Association)

Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine, May 2015

This repository hosts a copy of the AFLA stylesheet, the AFLA LaTeX class, and an example LaTeX file.

* The AFLA stylesheet here has been modified from previous versions to support the JIS B5 paper size and margins required by [Asia-Pacific Linguistics](http://pacling.anu.edu.au/), the publisher of AFLA proceedings since AFLA 21.
* The LaTeX class and example file was created by Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine, in preparation for AFLA 22.
